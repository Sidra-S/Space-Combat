# Space-Combat

## Abstract:
Space Combat is a game developed using Python where the goal of the player or agent is to shoot the enemies using bullets and obtain highscore within the fixed given time. For the game development, pygame module has been used. Pygame is a cross-platform set of python modules designed for  writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be use with python. The editor used for writing the code of the game is PyCharm. PyCharm is a dedicated Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) providing a wide range of essential tools for Python developers, tightly integrated to create a convenient environment for productive Python, web, and data science development.

## Working:
In this game, there is a player which controls the ship at the bottom of the screen. The enemies or invaders move across the screen. The player has to shoot the enemies/invaders with bullets. On shooting the enemy, it receives a reward of 5 points. In addition to enemies/invaders, there is a hijacked ship which the player has to avoid. If the hijacked ship gets shot with the bullet, there is a penalty of 3 points. The player has to create a highscore within the time limit of 1 minute 30 seconds.

## Installation Settings:
We have downloaded the PyCharm Community Edition from the link- https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/   
After downloading and installing the application, we downloaded the pygame module required for the game.
